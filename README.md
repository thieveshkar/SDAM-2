# Event Management System - C# Implementation

## Description
This project is part of a group assignment for the **COMP40003 Software Development and Application Modelling** module at **Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology (APIIT)**, Sri Lanka (Partnered with **Staffordshire University UK**). The assignment focuses on designing and implementing an **Event Management System** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **C# Programming**. The system provides an interface for managing events, participants, organizers, and bookings.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this assignment, we have achieved the following learning outcomes:

1. **OOP Implementation**
   - Applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** in developing a real-world application.
   
2. **Database Integration**
   - Integrated a **SQL database** for persistent data storage.
   
3. **Windows Forms Development**
   - Built a **Windows Forms application** for the Event Management System interface.

4. **Application Modelling and Testing**
   - Developed and tested functional modules for event, participant, and booking management.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thieveshkar/SDAM-2.git
    ```

2. **Setup the Database**:  
    - Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
    - Open the **SQL File** located at `SQL File/eventmanagementdb.sql`.
    - Execute the script to create and populate the database tables.

3. **Open the Project in Visual Studio**:  
    - Open the `CB013248_Windows_Forms` folder as a project in Visual Studio.
    - Open the solution file `CB013248_Windows_Forms.sln`.

4. **Build and Run the Application**:
